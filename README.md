Thank you for your response. Could you clarify what "1" refers to for your README? For example, do you want a minimal README, or is "1" the answer to one of my previous questions (such as the project description)?

If you want a simple and generic README for your RosmeoP/twoSum Python project, here’s a standard template you can use:

---

# twoSum

A Python project to solve the classic Two Sum problem.

## Description

Given an array of integers and a target value, this project provides a solution to find two numbers such that they add up to the target.

## Usage

```python
# Example usage
from two_sum import two_sum

nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]
target = 9
result = two_sum(nums, target)
print(result)  # Output: [0, 1]
```

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RosmeoP/twoSum.git
